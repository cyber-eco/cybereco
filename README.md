</p>


> 🌐 **A human-centered digital ecosystem for conscious, connected, and sustainable living**  
> In a world where digital life is fragmented, extractive, and overwhelming, CyberEco exists to offer a better path — one rooted in sovereignty, community, and balance.


## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start development
npm run dev

# 3. Open in browser
# Hub: http://localhost:40000
# JustSplit: http://localhost:40002
# Website: http://localhost:40001
```

That's it! 🎉 You're now running the CyberEco platform locally.

## 🏗️ What is CyberEco?

CyberEco is not just another app. It is a **modular digital ecosystem** — an operating system for life — where each platform solves a real need while contributing to a greater whole.

### Platform Philosophy

We believe your digital presence should empower you, not exploit you. Your identity should belong to you. Your data should serve you. Your actions should connect you with others meaningfully.

### Core Values

- **🔐 Digital Sovereignty** - You own your identity, your data, your narrative
- **🌱 Wellbeing by Design** - Tech must serve your life — not consume it
- **🔗 Interconnection with Purpose** - Every platform is useful alone, but transformative together
- **🤝 Community is Core** - We build tools for individuals, powered by the collective
- **📖 Open by Nature** - Modular, transparent, and interoperable wherever possible

### Current Applications

- **🏠 Hub** - Central authentication and app launcher (port 40000)
- **💰 JustSplit** - Expense splitting and financial management (port 40002)  
- **🌐 Website** - Marketing site and documentation (port 40001)
- **🚀 Future Apps** - Somos, Demos, Plantopia, and more

At the center is the **CyberEco Hub** — your identity, your dashboard, your digital home.

nx test hub              # Test Hub only
nx test justsplit-app    # Test JustSplit only
nx test website          # Test Website only
```

### Firebase Development
```bash
npm run emulators        # Start Firebase emulators
npm run hosting:justsplit # Test JustSplit with hosting emulator
npm run hosting:hub      # Test Hub with hosting emulator
npm run hosting:website  # Test Website with hosting emulator
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 + React 18 |
| **Language** | TypeScript |
| **Monorepo** | NX Workspace |
| **Backend** | Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting) |
| **Styling** | CSS Modules |
| **Testing** | Jest + React Testing Library |

## 🎯 Current Status & Next Steps

### ✅ Completed
- [x] NX monorepo setup with proper configuration and cleanup
- [x] Hub, JustSplit, and Website applications structure
- [x] Shared libraries (types, Firebase config, UI components, assets)
- [x] Multi-project Firebase setup (hub/justsplit/website)
- [x] Firebase emulator integration
- [x] Development workflow and comprehensive documentation
- [x] Codebase cleanup and legacy file removal

### 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Fix JustSplit runtime errors and stabilize
- [ ] Implement Hub authentication functionality
- [ ] Set up cross-app authentication flow

### 📋 Next Priorities
1. **Fix JustSplit Issues** - Resolve runtime errors and component issues
2. **Hub Development** - Build core authentication features
3. **Firebase Setup** - Configure production environments
4. **Testing** - Increase test coverage to 70%+
5. **CI/CD** - Set up automated testing and deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Monorepo Benefits
- **Shared Code**: Common types, utilities, and components
- **Fast Builds**: NX caching and incremental builds
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript coverage
- **Independent Deployment**: Apps can be deployed separately

### Firebase Multi-Project Setup
- **Hub Firebase Project**: Handles all authentication
- **App Firebase Projects**: Handle app-specific data (JustSplit, future apps)
- **Emulator Support**: Full local development without cloud dependencies

### 🌐 Long-Term Decentralized Vision

Beyond the current centralized architecture, CyberEco envisions a **decentralized future** where:

- **📱 Mobile P2P Networks** - Your phone becomes part of a global, distributed computing network
- **🔒 Complete Data Sovereignty** - You own and control 100% of your personal data  
- **🎯 Privacy by Design** - Zero-knowledge proofs enable sharing without exposing sensitive information
- **💰 Earn from Participation** - Get rewarded for contributing resources to the network
- **🌍 Global Accessibility** - No central servers, no geographic restrictions, no corporate gatekeepers
