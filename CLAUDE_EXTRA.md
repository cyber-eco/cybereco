  - Mobile menu state persistence using localStorage
  - Integrated theme and language switchers via ConfigDropdown
  - Responsive design with smooth animations

  UserMenu Component

  - Dropdown menu with user avatar and profile information
  - Configurable menu items with icons
  - Support for danger actions (like logout)
  - Click-outside and Escape key handling
  - Mobile-responsive design that adapts to screen size

  Footer Component

  - Flexible footer with customizable sections
  - Support for social links with icons
  - Company information display
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Built-in icon components (LinkedIn, GitHub, Email)

  Modal Component

  - Multiple size variants (small, medium, large, fullscreen)
  - Optional header with title and close button
  - Footer section for action buttons
  - Configurable close behaviors (overlay click, Escape key)
  - Focus management and body scroll prevention
  - Portal rendering for proper z-index handling

  Toast Component

  - 4 notification types (success, error, warning, info)
  - 6 position options (top/bottom √ó left/center/right)
  - Auto-dismiss with configurable duration
  - Optional action buttons
  - Both hook-based and imperative APIs

  - GlobalProvider: Unified context provider for theme, language, and toasts
  - AppLayout: Consistent layout wrapper for applications

  2. Application Integrations ‚úÖ

  Website App

  - Refactored Header to use shared Navigation component
  - Refactored Footer to use shared Footer component
  - Removed duplicate ConfigDropdown implementation
  - Created comprehensive integration tests
  - Fixed CSS Module errors (removed :root selectors)

  Hub App

  - Implemented shared Navigation with user authentication
  - Created UserMenu integration for logged-in users
  - Added logout functionality
  - Consistent styling with other apps

  JustSplit App

  - Implemented shared Navigation with app-specific links
  - Integrated UserMenu with Firebase authentication
  - Created Footer with JustSplit-specific content
  - Added GlobalProvider for theme/language/toast support

  3. Documentation Updates ‚úÖ

  - Added comprehensive "Shared Component Architecture" section to website documentation
  - Documented all key components and their features
  - Listed design principles (mobile-first, accessibility, etc.)
  - Provided usage examples
  - Updated searchable content for better discoverability

  4. Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ

  - Created comprehensive test suites for all new components
  - Mocked dependencies properly (Next.js router, Firebase, etc.)
  - Added CSS Module support to Jest configuration
  - Created test utilities and mock files

  üìä Technical Achievements

  Architecture Improvements

  1. Centralized UI Logic: All common UI components now live in libs/ui-components
  2. Consistent Theming: Theme variables defined once, used everywhere
  3. Unified Context: Single GlobalProvider manages theme, language, and toasts
  4. Type Safety: Full TypeScript support with exported interfaces
  5. Mobile-First: All components designed with mobile responsiveness in mind

  Code Quality

  1. DRY Principle: Eliminated duplicate code across applications
  2. Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between shared and app-specific code
  3. Testability: High test coverage with isolated unit tests
  4. Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

  Developer Experience

  1. Easy Integration: Simple imports from @cybereco/ui-components
  2. Flexible Configuration: Components accept props for customization
  3. Consistent Patterns: Similar API design across all components
  4. Clear Documentation: Both inline JSDoc and external documentation

  üöß Known Issues & Limitations

  1. JustSplit Test Configuration

  - Issue: Jest cannot resolve @cybereco/ui-components imports
  - Root Cause: Complex module resolution between Next.js, Jest, and NX
  - Current Workaround: Created mock files for testing
  - Impact: Tests run but don't test actual component integration

  2. NX Build Warnings

  - Issue: ESLint warnings about missing node modules
  - Impact: Warnings only, builds complete successfully
  - Solution: May need to clean and reinstall dependencies

  3. Website Static Export

  - Issue: Must use npm run build instead of nx build website
  - Root Cause: NX configuration conflict with Next.js static export
  - Impact: Deployment scripts must use npm directly

  üìã Next Steps & Recommendations

  High Priority Tasks

  1. Fix JustSplit Test Configuration

  # Potential solutions to explore:
  1. Update Jest configuration to use ts-jest transformer
  2. Configure module resolution to handle TypeScript paths
  3. Consider using NX's built-in Jest configuration
  4. Investigate babel-jest configuration for better TS support

  2. Create Additional Shared Components

  - Form Components: Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio
  - Data Display: Table, DataGrid, Pagination
  - Feedback: Progress, Skeleton, Spinner variations
  - Navigation: Tabs, Breadcrumbs, Stepper

  3. Implement Storybook

  # Setup Storybook for component documentation
  nx g @nx/storybook:configuration ui-components
  - Document all components with stories
  - Add interactive controls for props
  - Create usage examples
  - Set up visual regression testing

  Medium Priority Tasks

  4. Enhance Navigation with Search

  - Add search input to Navigation component
  - Implement search results dropdown
  - Add keyboard navigation for results
  - Consider using Algolia or similar for search

  5. Create Design System Documentation

  - Document color palette
  - Typography guidelines
  - Spacing system
  - Component usage patterns
  - Accessibility guidelines

  6. Performance Optimizations

  - Maintenance: Single source of truth for UI components
  - Quality: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability

  üöÄ Getting Started with the Components

  For developers wanting to use these components:

  // 1. Import from ui-components
  import {
    Navigation,
    UserMenu,
    Modal,
    toast,
    GlobalProvider
  } from '@cybereco/ui-components';

  // 2. Wrap app with GlobalProvider
  <GlobalProvider>
    <YourApp />
  </GlobalProvider>

  // 3. Use components
  <Navigation 
    links={navLinks}
    actionButton={userButton}
    showConfig={true}
  />

  // 4. Show notifications
  toast.success('Operation completed!');

  This shared component architecture provides a solid foundation for the CyberEco
  ecosystem's continued growth and development.
