# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this CyberEco NX monorepo. 

**üìã RECENT CLEANUP STATUS:** All legacy files have been cleaned from the repository as of May 30, 2025. The structure is now optimized for NX monorepo best practices.

## Project Overview

**CyberEco Monorepo** - A comprehensive platform for digital lifestyle management starting with expense splitting (JustSplit) and central authentication (Hub), expanding to priority applications like Somos (family roots explorer), Demos (community governance), and Plantopia (smart gardening). This NX-powered monorepo uses advanced caching, dependency management, and parallel execution for optimal developer experience.

## NX Monorepo Structure

This is an NX 19.8.14 monorepo with the following **cleaned and optimized** structure:
- `apps/hub` - Central authentication hub application (Next.js, port 3000)
- `apps/justsplit` - Expense splitting application (Next.js, port 4000)
- `apps/website` - Main CyberEco marketing website (Next.js, port 5000)
- `apps/somos` - Family roots explorer application (planned, Next.js)
- `apps/demos` - Community governance application (planned, Next.js)
- `apps/plantopia` - Smart gardening application (planned, Next.js)
- `libs/shared-types` - Shared TypeScript types and interfaces
- `libs/firebase-config` - Firebase configuration utilities and multi-project helpers
- `libs/ui-components` - Shared React UI components library with theming
- `libs/shared-assets` - Shared assets including logos and brand materials
- `firebase/hub/` - Hub Firebase deployment configuration
- `firebase/justsplit/` - JustSplit Firebase deployment configuration
- `firebase/website/` - Website Firebase deployment configuration
- `archived/` - Legacy code archives (old website moved here)
- `nx.json` - NX workspace configuration with caching and task runners

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Root-level `src/`, `public/`, and legacy config files have been removed. Each app manages its own configuration.

- Root-level `src/` and `public/` directories removed (were outdated duplicates)
- All build artifacts and backup files cleaned (see TO_CLEANSE.md for details)

## Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Architecture
- **Monorepo Tool**: NX 19.8.14 with advanced build caching and task orchestration
- **Build System**: NX with computation caching, parallel execution (max 3), and affected commands
- **Shared Libraries**: Types, UI components, Firebase configuration, and assets in `libs/`
- **Multi-Project Firebase**: Hub for centralized auth, individual projects for app-specific data
- **Package Scope**: `@cybereco` namespace for all shared libraries
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Firebase hosting with separate hosting targets per app

### Framework Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, React 18
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth) with multi-project support
- **Styling**: CSS Modules with shared UI components
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library, 70% coverage threshold
- **Website**: Static site generation with Next.js export

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Multi-Project Firebase Setup**:
- Hub project (`firebase/hub/`) handles centralized authentication
- JustSplit project (`firebase/justsplit/`) handles expense-specific data
- Website project (`firebase/website/`) serves the static marketing site
- Shared configuration in `libs/firebase-config`
- Cross-project token verification and user management

**Shared Libraries Structure**:
- `libs/shared-types` (`@cybereco/shared-types`) - Common TypeScript interfaces and types
- `libs/firebase-config` (`@cybereco/firebase-config`) - Firebase utilities and multi-project configuration
- `libs/ui-components` (`@cybereco/ui-components`) - Reusable React components with CSS Modules
- `libs/shared-assets` (`@cybereco/shared-assets`) - Common assets including logos and brand materials

**Context-Based State Management**:
Each app uses React Context for global state:
- `AuthProvider` - User authentication state (from hub)
- `AppProvider` - Application-wide state
- `NotificationProvider` - Toast notifications and alerts

**Component Structure**:
- App Router pages in `apps/*/src/app/`
- Reusable components in `libs/ui-components/`
- App-specific components in `apps/*/src/components/`

**Data Models**:
Core entities defined in `libs/shared-types/src/`:
- Hub entities: `AuthUser`, `HubUser`, `App`, `AppPermission`
- JustSplit entities: `User`, `Group`, `Event`, `Expense`, `Settlement`
- Somos entities (planned): `FamilyMember`, `Relationship`, `Memory`, `CulturalBackground`
- Demos entities (planned): `Community`, `Proposal`, `Vote`, `Decision`
- Plantopia entities (planned): `Plant`, `Garden`, `CareEvent`, `PlantSpecies`

**NX Project Configuration**:
- Each app/lib has a `project.json` defining build targets and executors
- Standard targets: `build`, `serve`, `dev`, `test`, `lint`, `export`
- Specialized targets: `deploy`, `emulators`, `hosting:emulator`, `hosting:dev`
- Apps use `@nx/next` executors, libraries use `@nx/js:tsc` or `@nx/react:build`
- Custom NX executors (`nx:run-commands`) for Firebase operations

### Testing Strategy

Tests are co-located with components in `__tests__` directories. Each app maintains 70% coverage. Test files use the pattern `*.test.tsx` for components and `*.test.ts` for utilities.

### Firebase Emulator Setup

Development uses Firebase emulators running on:
- Firestore: localhost:8080
- Auth: localhost:9099
- UI: localhost:5002
- Website hosting: localhost:5000
- Hub hosting: localhost:3000
- JustSplit hosting: localhost:4000

The emulator data persists in `./emulator-data/` and is automatically imported/exported on start/stop.

### Module Aliases

Each app has its own tsconfig with aliases:
- `@/components/*` ‚Üí `./src/components/*`
- `@/context/*` ‚Üí `./src/context/*`
- `@/utils/*` ‚Üí `./src/utils/*`
- `@cybereco/shared-types` ‚Üí `libs/shared-types`
- `@cybereco/firebase-config` ‚Üí `libs/firebase-config`
- `@cybereco/ui-components` ‚Üí `libs/ui-components`
- `@cybereco/shared-assets` ‚Üí `libs/shared-assets`

## Working with NX

### Creating New Components
```bash
# In a library (use @nx instead of @nrwl)
nx g @nx/react:component Button --project=ui-components

# In an app
nx g @nx/react:component Header --project=justsplit-app
nx g @nx/react:component Dashboard --project=hub
```

### Creating New Libraries
```bash
# TypeScript library
nx g @nx/js:library feature-name --directory=shared

# React component library
nx g @nx/react:library component-name --directory=shared
```

### Checking Affected Projects
```bash
nx affected:apps --base=main
nx affected:libs --base=main
```

### Build Order and Caching
- NX automatically determines build order based on dependency graph
- Build caching is enabled for `build`, `test`, `lint`, and `e2e` operations
- Use `nx dep-graph` to visualize project dependencies
- Use `nx reset` to clear the NX cache when needed
- Parallel execution is limited to 3 concurrent tasks for optimal performance

### NX Configuration Details
- **npmScope**: `cybereco` - used for package naming and imports
- **defaultProject**: `justsplit-app` - the primary application
- **Task Runner**: Uses default NX task runner with caching enabled
- **Target Dependencies**: Build targets depend on upstream library builds
- **Named Inputs**: Production builds exclude test files and configs
