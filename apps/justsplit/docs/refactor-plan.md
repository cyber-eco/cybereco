## Comprehensive Refactoring Plan

### 1. Component Architecture Restructuring

Currently, your application has a mix of page components and reusable components, but there's opportunity to create a more modular structure:

1. **Create a UI Component Library**
   - Move all reusable UI components to a dedicated `/components/ui` directory
   - Extract common patterns (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.) into their own components

2. **Feature-based Organization**
   - Group components by feature (events, expenses, settlements, etc.)
   - Each feature should have its own directory with domain-specific components

3. **Shared Layouts**
   - Create layout components for consistent page structures
   - Implement consistent header, footer, and navigation components

### 2. Styling Architecture

1. **CSS Module Consolidation**
   - Create a base styles directory with theme variables
   - Establish a component-specific vs. global styles separation
   - Implement a design system with consistent spacing, colors, typography

2. **Design System Implementation**
   - Define a set of design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
   - Create a theme provider for consistent styling across the application
   - Document the design system for future development

### 3. State Management Refactoring

1. **Context Optimization**
   - Split the AppContext into domain-specific contexts (EventsContext, ExpensesContext)
   - Implement context selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders

2. **Data Management**
   - Introduce data fetching hooks for each domain
   - Separate read/write operations into distinct functions
   - Add proper error handling and loading states

### 4. Utilities and Helpers

1. **Utility Function Organization**
   - Create domain-specific utility files (eventUtils, expenseUtils, etc.)
   - Move calculation functions from components to utility files
   - Implement proper typing for all utilities

2. **Common Helpers**
   - Extract date formatting and manipulation to dedicated helpers
   - Create currency and amount formatting utilities
   - Implement reusable calculation functions

### 5. Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test all utility functions and helpers
   - Create tests for individual components

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify context and state management





I'll help you create a detailed refactoring plan for your JustSplit application. Looking at your codebase, I can see that you've got a Next.js application with React components, and you'd like to homogenize the design and functionality across pages. Let's start with a high-level plan and then dive into a more detailed implementation strategy.

## Comprehensive Refactoring Plan

### 1. Component Architecture Assessment

First, I'll analyze your current component structure and identify opportunities for better organization and reuse.

### 2. Design System Implementation

Based on your existing CSS modules, I'll propose a cohesive design system that can be applied throughout the application.

### 3. Shared Components Library

I'll identify which components are reused across pages and should be extracted into a shared components library.

### 4. State Management Optimization

I'll examine your state management approach and suggest improvements for consistency and performance.

### 5. Page Structure Standardization

I'll create a consistent page structure that can be applied across all routes in your application.

### 6. Code Quality Enhancement

I'll suggest patterns for error handling, loading states, and other best practices.

### 7. Testing Strategy

I'll review your existing tests and propose a comprehensive testing approach.

## Detailed Implementation Plan for Starting the Refactoring

Let's begin with the most critical areas:

### Phase 1: Establish Design System Foundation

#### 1. Create a Shared Theme Variables File

```
1. Create a new file: src/styles/theme.css
2. Extract all CSS variables from individual module files
3. Standardize color palette, typography, spacing, and shadows
4. Import the theme file in globals.css
```

#### 2. Audit Existing UI Components

```
1. Review all existing components for visual consistency
2. Identify design patterns that can be standardized
3. Document UI inconsistencies for targeted refactoring
4. Create a design system documentation page
```

#### 3. Implement Core UI Components

```
1. Create base components in src/components/ui:
   - Button (primary, secondary, tertiary variants)
   - Card
   - Input
   - Form elements
   - Typography components
2. Ensure components are fully responsive
3. Add proper accessibility attributes
4. Include comprehensive props for flexibility
```

### Phase 2: Page Structure Refactoring

#### 1. Create Layout Components

```
1. Develop a standard page layout component
2. Implement consistent header and footer
3. Create section components for content organization
4. Build breadcrumb navigation for better UX
```

#### 2. Standardize Page Structure

```
1. Establish consistent patterns for:
   - Page headers
   - Action buttons placement
   - Form layouts
   - List views
2. Refactor one page at a time, starting with highest traffic pages
3. Test each refactored page thoroughly
```

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing

```
1. Integrate refactored components across all pages
2. Update tests to reflect new component structure
3. Perform cross-browser and responsive testing
4. Conduct usability testing for refactored interfaces
```

## Immediate First Steps (Day 1-3)

1. **Create Theme Variables File**
   - Extract common colors from various CSS modules
   - Define typography scales
   - Define spacing system
   - Document usage patterns

2. **Implement Button Component**
   - Create a reusable Button component with variants
   - Support for different sizes, states, and icons
   - Replace all button instances in one page as proof of concept

3. **Refactor Card Components**
   - Create standardized Card components
   - Support for different content types
   - Implement consistent padding, borders, and shadows

4. **Create Testing Suite for New Components**
   - Unit tests for each new component
   - Integration tests for component combinations
   - Visual regression tests to ensure consistency
