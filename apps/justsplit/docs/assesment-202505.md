# JustSplit Project Assessment

## Overview
Based on the provided test report, JustSplit appears to be an expense-sharing application similar to Splitwise. The application allows users to track shared expenses, split bills among multiple users, calculate settlements, support multiple currencies with conversion, and visualize expense trends through charts.

## Project Structure
The project appears to be a modern React application built with TypeScript. The structure seems to follow a clean organization with dedicated folders for components, utilities, and app pages.

```

## Test Coverage Assessment

### Overall Statistics
- **Test Suites**: 19 total, 16 passing (84%), 3 failing (16%)
- **Tests**: 79 total, 74 passing (94%), 5 failing (6%)

This indicates a good overall test coverage with most tests passing. However, the failing tests point to several critical issues that need addressing.

### Failing Tests Analysis

#### 1. Header Component (`Header.test.tsx`)
- **Issue**: Test "displays user name when logged in" is failing
- **Cause**: Unable to find element with data-testid="user-profile"
- **Severity**: Medium - User authentication UI is not working correctly
- **Fix Required**: Implement proper rendering of the user profile element when a user is logged in

#### 2. Currency Exchange (`currencyExchange.test.ts`)
- **Issues**:
  - Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ok')
  - API Error handling failures
  - Property `getExchangeRate` does not exist in the provided object
- **Severity**: High - Currency conversion is a core functionality for an expense-sharing app
- **Fixes Required**:
  - Fix the API response handling in the currency exchange module
  - Implement proper error handling for API failures
  - Ensure the `getExchangeRate` function is properly exported and accessible for testing

#### 3. Expense Calculator (`expenseCalculator.test.ts`)
- **Issue**: Settlement calculation with currency conversion fails
- **Cause**: Mismatch between expected and actual structure of settlement objects
- **Severity**: High - Affects core functionality of correctly calculating who owes what
- **Fix Required**: Update the expense calculator to properly include expense IDs and handle event IDs correctly

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: The project has extensive tests for components and utilities
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between components and utilities
3. **Feature Richness**: Support for currencies, events, and visualization indicates a full-featured application

### Areas for Improvement
1. **API Integration**: The currency exchange functionality has multiple issues with API handling
2. **Data Structure Consistency**: Discrepancies in expected vs. actual data structures
3. **Logging**: Excessive console logging in the MonthlyTrendsChart component

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Fix Currency Exchange Module**:
   - Review and fix the API response handling at line 82 in `currencyExchange.ts`
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Ensure the module exports the expected functions

2. **Update Expense Calculator**:
   - Fix the settlements calculation to correctly include expense IDs
   - Address the inconsistency with eventId handling

3. **Fix Header Component**:
   - Ensure the user profile element is rendered when a user is logged in

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Reduce Console Logging**: Remove or limit the extensive logging in MonthlyTrendsChart to improve performance
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling across the application
3. **Testing Mocks**: Review the mocking strategy for external dependencies in tests

### Feature Roadmap Alignment
Based on the tests and components, the application appears to have:
- User authentication
- Expense tracking
- Currency conversion
- Group expense management by events
- Visualization of expense trends

Without access to a specific roadmap document, it's difficult to verify complete alignment. However, the failing tests suggest that core features like currency conversion and expense settlement calculations need attention before new features are added.

## Conclusion
JustSplit appears to be a well-structured and comprehensive expense-sharing application with good test coverage. The failing tests highlight specific areas that need fixing to ensure the core functionality works correctly. Once these issues are addressed, the application should be robust enough to handle expense sharing across different currencies and user groups.
