# CyberEco Security & Compliance Framework

> **🛡️ Security by Design**: CyberEco's approach to security and compliance reflects our commitment to user privacy, data sovereignty, and transparent operations. This framework ensures robust protection while maintaining our human-centered values.

## 🎯 Security Philosophy

### Core Principles

**🔐 Privacy by Default**
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Minimal data collection - only what's necessary for functionality
- User control over all personal information sharing
- No backdoors or surveillance capabilities

**🌱 Transparent Security**
- Open-source security components where possible
- Regular public security audits and penetration testing
- Clear communication about security practices and incidents
- User education about digital security best practices

**🤝 Human-Centered Security**
- Security measures that enhance rather than hinder user experience
- Accessible security controls for users of all technical levels
- Respect for user autonomy in security decision-making
- Protection that scales with user needs and comfort levels
