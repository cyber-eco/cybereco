This document outlines the core data models used in the JustSplit application, detailing the structure, relationships, and attributes of the data entities involved in expense tracking and management.

## Overview

The JustSplit platform uses several interconnected data models to manage users, expenses, events, and settlements across multiple applications in an NX monorepo architecture:

- **Hub App** (`apps/hub`): Central authentication and application management
- **JustSplit App** (`apps/justsplit`): Core expense splitting functionality  
- **Shared Types** (`libs/shared-types`): Platform-wide authentication and app models
- **App-Specific Types** (`apps/justsplit/src/types`): JustSplit domain models
- **Firebase Config** (`libs/firebase-config`): Shared Firebase configuration
- **UI Components** (`libs/ui-components`): Shared component library

## Core Models

### Expense

Represents a shared expense incurred by one or more users.

### Attributes
- **id**: Unique identifier for the expense (String)
- **description**: A brief description of the expense (String)
- **amount**: Total amount of the expense (Number)
- **currency**: Currency in which the expense is recorded (String)
- **date**: Date when the expense was incurred (String in ISO format)
- **paidBy**: User ID of the person who paid for the expense (String)
- **splitMethod**: Method used to split the expense (String: equal, custom, percentage)
- **participants**: List of users involved in the expense (Array of User IDs with share information)
- **eventId**: Optional ID of the event this expense belongs to (String, optional)
- **settled**: Boolean indicating whether the expense has been settled (Boolean)
- **notes**: Detailed description or notes about the expense (String, optional)
- **images**: List of image URLs associated with the expense (Array of Strings, optional)

## User

Represents a user participating in the expense sharing.

### Attributes
- **id**: Unique identifier for the user (String)
- **name**: Full name of the user (String)
- **email**: Email address of the user (String, optional)
- **phoneNumber**: Phone number of the user (String, optional)
- **preferredCurrency**: Preferred currency for the user (String, optional)
- **balance**: Current balance of the user in relation to shared expenses (Number)

## Event

Represents an event that groups related expenses (formerly called Trip/Event).

### Attributes
- **id**: Unique identifier for the event (String)
- **name**: Name of the event (String)
- **startDate**: Start date of the event (String in ISO format)
- **endDate**: End date of the event (String in ISO format, optional)
- **participants**: List of users participating in the event (Array of User IDs)
- **expenses**: List of expenses associated with the event (Array of Expense IDs)
- **preferredCurrency**: Preferred currency for the event (String, optional)

## Settlement

Represents a settlement transaction between users.

### Attributes
- **id**: Unique identifier for the settlement (String)
- **fromUser**: User ID of the person making the payment (String)
- **toUser**: User ID of the person receiving the payment (String)
- **amount**: Amount being settled (Number)
- **currency**: Currency in which the settlement is recorded (String)
- **date**: Date of the settlement (String in ISO format)
- **expenseIds**: List of expense IDs associated with this settlement (Array of Strings)
- **eventId**: Optional ID of the event this settlement is related to (String, optional)

## Relationships

- An **Expense** is paid by one **User** and can have multiple **Users** as participants
- A **User** can pay for multiple **Expenses** and participate in multiple **Expenses**
- An **Event** contains multiple **Expenses** and has multiple **User** participants
- A **Settlement** involves two **Users** (payer and recipient) and is linked to one or more **Expenses**
- A **Settlement** can optionally be linked to an **Event**

This structured approach to data modeling ensures clarity in how data is managed within the JustSplit application, facilitating efficient expense tracking and settlement processes.
