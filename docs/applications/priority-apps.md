## üîÑ Integration Architecture

### Cross-Application Authentication

All priority applications will integrate with CyberEco Hub for authentication using Firebase Authentication with the following flow:

1. User signs in through Hub (primary authentication point)
2. Hub generates a custom Firebase token for the target application
3. Target application exchanges the custom token for an application-specific session
4. User profile information is synchronized through Firestore with appropriate security rules

### Data Sharing & Privacy

1. **User-Controlled Sharing**
   - Default: No cross-app data sharing
   - Explicit user consent required for all sharing
   - Granular permission controls for each data type

2. **Shared Data Storage**
   - Hub maintains master user profile
   - Application-specific data in separate Firestore collections
   - Cross-references using consistent user IDs

3. **Privacy Implementation**
   ```typescript
   interface CrossAppPermission {
     sourceApp: 'hub' | 'justsplit' | 'somos' | 'demos' | 'plantopia';
     targetApp: 'hub' | 'justsplit' | 'somos' | 'demos' | 'plantopia';
     dataTypes: string[]; // What data can be shared
     expirationDate?: Date; // Optional time limit
     accessLevel: 'read' | 'write' | 'read-write';
     createdAt: Date;
     lastModified: Date;
   }
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è NX Workspace Integration

Each priority application will be added to the NX monorepo with the following structure:

```
