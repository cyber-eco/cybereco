# CyberEco Licensing and Contributor Agreements

> **ðŸŒ± Human-Centered Licensing**: This document provides an overview of the CyberEco Platform's licensing model and contributor agreements, designed to protect digital sovereignty while fostering community contribution.

## Overview

The CyberEco platform operates under a custom licensing model designed to balance several key priorities:

1. **Protecting User Digital Sovereignty**
2. **Preventing Extractive Business Models**
3. **Allowing Personal and Commercial Use**
4. **Encouraging Community Contributions**
5. **Preserving the Platform's Core Philosophy**

## CyberEco Digital Sovereignty License

The platform is licensed under the **CyberEco Digital Sovereignty License v1.0**, a custom license that builds upon the Elastic License 2.0 while incorporating our core values and philosophy.

### Key License Features

#### Permissions

The license explicitly permits:

- **Personal Use**: Using the software for individual purposes
- **Commercial Use**: Using the software in a commercial context when you or your organization are the direct end-user
- **Modification**: Adapting the software to your needs
- **Distribution**: Sharing the software with others (under the same license)
- **Deployment**: Installing the software for yourself, your organization, or your clients

#### Limitations

The license prohibits:

- **Hosted Service**: Offering the software as a managed service to third parties
- **Data Extraction**: Using users' data in ways that violate sovereignty principles
- **Fee-Based Access**: Charging for use of the unmodified software as its primary value

#### Requirements

The license requires:

- **User Data Ownership**: Respecting users' ownership of their data
- **Transparency**: Being clear about how data is used and stored
- **Privacy by Design**: Maintaining privacy protections
- **No Dark Patterns**: Avoiding deceptive user interfaces
- **Data Portability**: Preserving users' ability to export their data

### Compatibility with Open Source

While the CyberEco Digital Sovereignty License includes certain restrictions to protect against extractive practices, it embraces many core values of open source software:

- **Transparency**: Source code is open and readable
- **Collaboration**: Community contributions are encouraged
- **User Freedom**: Software can be used and modified freely
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Data portability is protected

The restrictions exist solely to ensure the software remains aligned with its founding philosophy of human-centered technology and digital sovereignty.

## Contributor Agreement

### Key Agreement Features

#### Rights Granted

Contributors grant:

- **Copyright License**: Permission to use, modify, and distribute their contributions
- **Patent License**: Protection from patent claims related to contributed code
- **Moral Rights Waiver**: Agreement not to assert moral rights in ways that would restrict the project

#### Philosophical Alignment

## Rationale

This licensing and contributor model was chosen to create a "digital commons" that resists the extractive practices that have come to dominate much of the software industry. By placing clear boundaries around certain forms of commercialization while keeping the code open and accessible, we aim to ensure that CyberEco platforms remain:

1. **Sovereign**: Under user control, not corporate extraction
2. **Sustainable**: Developed for long-term community benefit
3. **Accessible**: Available to individuals and organizations that respect user rights
4. **Protected**: Resistant to co-option by extractive business models

## Questions and Interpretations

1. Open a GitHub issue with your question
2. Contact the project maintainers directly
3. Consult the [PHILOSOPHY.md](../PHILOSOPHY.md) document for guidance on the spirit of interpretation
