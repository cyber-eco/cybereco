# Code Style Guidelines for JustSplit

To maintain consistency and readability across the JustSplit codebase, all contributors are expected to adhere to the following coding standards and style guidelines.

## General Guidelines

- **Use Meaningful Names**: Variable, function, and class names should be descriptive and convey their purpose.
- **Consistent Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation. Avoid using tabs.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters. Break long lines to improve readability.
- **Comments**: Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic. Use comments to describe the purpose of functions and classes.

## JavaScript Style

- **Use ES6+ Syntax**: Prefer modern JavaScript features such as `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and template literals.
- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons at the end of statements.
- **Function Declarations**: Use function declarations instead of function expressions for named functions.
- **Single Quotes**: Use single quotes for strings, except when the string contains a single quote character.

## HTML/CSS Style

- **HTML Structure**: Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`).
- **CSS Naming Convention**: Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for class names to improve clarity and maintainability.
- **CSS Formatting**: Use a consistent format for CSS properties, with each property on a new line and a space after the colon.

## React Component Guidelines

- **Functional Components**: Prefer functional components over class components.
- **Prop Types**: Use PropTypes to define the expected types of props for components.
- **State Management**: Use React hooks for managing state and side effects.

## Testing Guidelines

- **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage for all new features.
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Write clear and descriptive names for test cases to indicate what is being tested.

## Linting and Formatting

- **ESLint**: Use ESLint with the recommended configuration to enforce coding standards.
- **Prettier**: Use Prettier for code formatting to ensure a consistent style across the codebase.

## Conclusion

By following these code style guidelines, we can ensure that the JustSplit project remains maintainable, readable, and accessible for all contributors. Thank you for your cooperation!
