## 💎 Token Economics (CYE)

### Utility Functions
- **Network Fees**: Pay for computational resources and storage
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on protocol changes and feature development  
- **Staking Rewards**: Earn tokens by contributing resources to network
- **Privacy Features**: Access advanced privacy-preserving tools

### Economic Model
```typescript
interface NetworkEconomics {
  totalSupply: 1_000_000_000;        // 1 billion CYE tokens
  inflationRate: 0.03;               // 3% annual inflation for rewards
  
  rewardDistribution: {
    networkParticipation: 0.60;      // 60% to node operators
    developmentFund: 0.25;           // 25% to platform development
    communityGrants: 0.10;           // 10% to community projects
    teamAllocation: 0.05;            // 5% to core team
  };
}
```
