# CyberEco Platform Development Roadmap

> **üåø Human-Centered Evolution**: This roadmap outlines CyberEco's journey toward building a comprehensive human-centered digital ecosystem that prioritizes digital sovereignty, wellbeing by design, and meaningful community connections.

## üéØ Vision Alignment

Our development roadmap supports CyberEco's mission to create technology that:
- **üîê Empowers Digital Sovereignty**: User-controlled data and digital identity
- **üå± Promotes Wellbeing**: Technology that enhances rather than exploits human attention
- **ü§ù Fosters Community**: Applications that strengthen social bonds and mutual aid
- **üîì Embraces Openness**: Transparent, inclusive, and collaborative development

For comprehensive platform evolution details, see our [main ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) covering the three-phase transition from centralized foundation to decentralized ecosystem.
