- Consistent user profiles across applications
- Privacy-preserving identity verification

### 2. **Data Sharing & Privacy**
- User-controlled data sharing between apps
- Granular permissions for cross-app data access
- Privacy-first design with encryption

### 3. **Unified Experience**
- Consistent design language and interaction patterns
- Seamless transitions between applications
- Shared notification system

### 4. **Value Exchange**
- Cross-app incentives and rewards
- Shared economic system (future token model)
- Resource allocation across applications

## 🔮 Decentralized Future

In the decentralized vision ([2030+](/docs/ROADMAP.md)), this application matrix evolves to become:

1. **User-Sovereign** - Users fully own and control their data across all apps
2. **Peer-to-Peer** - Applications operate on a distributed network of devices
3. **Community-Governed** - Ecosystem development directed by user governance
4. **Token-Powered** - Economic incentives align app usage with contribution
