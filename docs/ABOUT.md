# About CyberEco

> 🌟 **We are building a human-centered digital ecosystem for conscious, connected, and sustainable living.**

## 🎯 Who We Are

CyberEco is a human-centered digital ecosystem for conscious, connected, and sustainable living. In a world where digital life is fragmented, extractive, and overwhelming, CyberEco exists to offer a better path — one rooted in sovereignty, community, and balance.

We believe your digital presence should empower you, not exploit you. Your identity should belong to you. Your data should serve you. Your actions should connect you with others meaningfully.

## 🌱 Why We Exist

**In a world where digital life is fragmented, extractive, and overwhelming, CyberEco exists to offer a better path — one rooted in sovereignty, community, and balance.**

The digital world has become increasingly disconnected from human values. We created CyberEco to bridge this gap, providing digital solutions that align with how people naturally want to connect, collaborate, and live sustainably.

## 🏗️ What We Are

CyberEco is not just another app. It is a **modular digital ecosystem** — an operating system for life — where each platform solves a real need while contributing to a greater whole.

- **A place to manage your finances** (JustSplit)
- **A place to resolve conflicts peacefully** (Future: Community governance tools)
- **A place to grow, learn, vote, connect, and belong** (Future applications)
- **A place where your values and data align**

At the center is the **CyberEco Hub** — your identity, your dashboard, your digital home.

## 🎯 Our Vision & Mission

### Vision
To empower millions of people — not with more notifications, but with clarity, autonomy, and connection. To create a digital environment as human, intentional, and resilient as the world we deserve offline.

### Mission
To create a modular digital ecosystem — an operating system for life — where each platform solves a real need while contributing to a greater whole, centered around the CyberEco Hub as your identity, your dashboard, your digital home.

## 💎 Our Values

### 🔐 Digital Sovereignty
**You own your identity, your data, your narrative.** We create technology that empowers rather than exploits. Your digital presence should serve your interests, not corporate agendas.

### 🌱 Wellbeing by Design
**Tech must serve your life — not consume it.** We design solutions that enhance your wellbeing rather than draining it. Every feature is evaluated through the lens of human flourishing.

### 🔗 Interconnection with Purpose
**Every platform is useful alone, but transformative together.** We create an ecosystem of solutions that complement each other, amplifying their individual value through thoughtful integration.

### 🤝 Community is Core
**We build tools for individuals, powered by the collective.** Community engagement and collaborative growth are at the heart of our ecosystem. Individual empowerment and collective wisdom go hand in hand.

### 📖 Open by Nature
**Wherever possible, CyberEco is modular, transparent, and interoperable.** We embrace openness and collaboration in our development approach, building bridges instead of walls.

You own and control 100% of your personal data through cryptographic guarantees and self-sovereign identity systems.

#### 🎯 Privacy by Design
Zero-knowledge proofs enable sharing insights and collaborating without exposing sensitive personal information.

#### 💰 Participation Economy
Users earn tokens for contributing computing resources, data insights, and community value to the network.

#### 🌍 Global Accessibility
No central servers, no geographic restrictions, no corporate gatekeepers — truly global, censorship-resistant access.
