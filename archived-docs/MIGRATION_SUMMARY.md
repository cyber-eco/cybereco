# Monorepo Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated JustSplit to a monorepo architecture with the following structure:
- Central authentication hub for user management
- Modular applications with shared resources
- Multi-project Firebase setup for scalable, low-cost deployments

## Key Changes

### 1. Monorepo Structure
- Created `apps/` directory with `hub` and `justsplit` applications
- Created `packages/` directory with shared types, Firebase config, and UI components
- Set up pnpm workspaces and Turborepo for efficient builds

### 2. Hub Application
- Built a minimal authentication hub at `apps/hub/`
- Implements central login/logout functionality
- Provides app launcher interface
- Manages user permissions across applications

### 3. Firebase Multi-Project Architecture
- Hub project manages all authentication
- App projects manage app-specific data
- Shared configuration utilities in `packages/firebase-config/`
- Temporary multi-project config in `apps/justsplit/src/firebase/multi-project-config.ts`

### 4. Test Fixes
- Fixed Timeline test by adding required event properties
- Fixed RecentSettlements test by handling date localization
- Fixed ExpenseDistribution test by adding required `createdAt` field

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- Created separate Firebase configurations for hub and JustSplit
- Added deployment scripts for manual deployment
- Created GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Install pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Set up Firebase projects (hub and app)
4. Configure environment variables
5. Test the monorepo: `pnpm test`

### Future Enhancements
1. Complete the `@cybereco/firebase-config` package implementation
2. Migrate more components to the shared UI library
3. Add more applications to the monorepo
4. Implement cross-app data sharing mechanisms
5. Add service accounts for secure inter-project communication

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Centralized Authentication**: Single sign-on across all applications
2. **Code Reusability**: Shared packages reduce duplication
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new applications
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Multiple apps share authentication infrastructure
5. **Type Safety**: Shared types ensure consistency
6. **Independent Deployment**: Apps can be deployed separately

## Migration Artifacts

- `MONOREPO_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed architecture design
- Updated `README.md` - Monorepo documentation
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` - Developer guidance for monorepo
- Deployment scripts in `scripts/`
- GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`

## Known Issues

1. The `@cybereco/firebase-config` package import needs to be completed
2. Some tests may need adjustment for the monorepo structure
3. Environment variables need to be configured for both hub and app

## Testing the Migration

1. Run all tests: `pnpm test`
2. Start development servers: `pnpm dev`
3. Access hub at http://localhost:3000
4. Access JustSplit at http://localhost:4000
