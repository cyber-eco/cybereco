## feat: implement SSO authentication system and enhance Hub UI/UX

### Summary
Implemented a comprehensive Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication system with Hub as the central auth provider, along with significant UI/UX improvements to the Hub dashboard and applications pages.

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Single Sign-On (SSO) System
- **Central Authentication Hub**: Hub now serves as the authentication provider for all ecosystem apps
- **Cross-Origin Auth Solution**: Implemented secure token-based authentication to handle cross-port scenarios
  - Auth tokens with SHA-256 signatures and 30-second expiry
  - URL-based token passing for secure cross-origin authentication
  - Fallback mechanisms for same-origin scenarios
- **Auth Persistence**: Added localStorage caching for faster auth state recovery
- **Shared Auth State**: Implemented shared authentication state management across apps

#### 2. Authentication Flow Improvements
- **Faster Sign-In/Out**: Removed artificial delays, optimized auth state checks
- **Better Error Handling**: Fixed Firebase emulator errors and Firestore permission issues
- **Immediate UI Response**: Dashboard shows sign-in prompt immediately for non-authenticated users
- **Auth State Caching**: Implemented 5-minute cache for auth state to improve performance

#### 3. Hub UI/UX Enhancements
- **Modern Dashboard Design**:
  - Created dedicated dashboard.module.css with cohesive styling
  - Enhanced metric cards with hover effects and skeleton loading states
  - Improved activity feed with proper scrolling and visual indicators
  - Responsive grid layout for all screen sizes
  
- **Enhanced Applications Page**:
  - Updated AppGrid cards to match design system (removed glassmorphism)
  - Increased spacing and card height for better visual hierarchy
  - Added gradient text effects and smooth animations
  - Improved responsive behavior with proper breakpoints

- **Visual Consistency**:
  - Consistent use of CSS variables across all components
  - Better typography with larger headings and proper letter-spacing
  - Enhanced hover states with elevation effects
  - Proper dark theme support throughout

#### 4. JustSplit Integration
- **Hub Button**: Added Hub navigation button to JustSplit header
- **User Menu**: Integrated settings with user profile dropdown
- **Auth Bridge**: Implemented auth bridge for seamless SSO experience
- **Firebase Fixes**: Fixed undefined eventId error in expense creation

#### 5. Documentation and Architecture
- **SSO Implementation Guide**: Comprehensive documentation in SSO_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- **Architecture Docs**: Updated auth-bridge-implementation.md and lightweight-apps-architecture.md
- **Production Setup**: Added production-auth-setup.md for deployment guidance
- **API Reference**: Created sso-api-reference.md for developers

### Technical Changes

#### New Files Added
- `apps/hub/src/hooks/useHubAuth.ts` - Custom hook for optimized auth state
- `apps/hub/src/lib/auth-persistence.ts` - Auth caching implementation
- `apps/hub/src/services/authTokenService.ts` - Token generation service
- `apps/hub/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.module.css` - Enhanced dashboard styles
- `libs/auth/src/shared-auth-state.ts` - Shared auth state management
- Multiple test files for auth components

#### Modified Core Components
- `apps/hub/src/components/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with session sync
- `apps/hub/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Refactored with new styles
- `apps/hub/src/components/AppGrid.tsx` - Optimized loading and auth checks
- `apps/justsplit/src/context/JustSplitAuthContext.tsx` - Integrated with Hub SSO
- `libs/firebase-config/src/config.ts` - Added error handling for emulator

#### Scripts and Utilities
- `scripts/deploy-production.sh` - Production deployment script
- `scripts/fix-firebase-emulator.sh` - Emulator troubleshooting
- `scripts/test-sso-flow.js` - SSO testing utilities

### Breaking Changes
- None - All changes are backward compatible

### Migration Notes
- Apps need to implement AuthTokenService to participate in SSO
- Update Firebase security rules to handle cross-app authentication
- Configure production domains in Firebase Auth settings

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for auth components
- Created test utilities for SSO flow validation
- Implemented debug panels for development (removed from commit)

### Performance Improvements
- Auth state loads instantly from cache
- Reduced Firebase queries during auth transitions
- Eliminated unnecessary loading states
- Optimized component re-renders

### Known Issues Addressed
- Fixed: Dashboard showing loading spinner for non-authenticated users
- Fixed: Firebase "false for 'list' @ L12" error during logout
- Fixed: Slow login/logout with Firebase emulator
- Fixed: JustSplit undefined eventId error

### Future Enhancements
- Implement refresh token mechanism
- Add multi-factor authentication support
- Create admin panel for user management
- Add analytics for auth flow monitoring
